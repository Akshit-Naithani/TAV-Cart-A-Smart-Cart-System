My final year capstone project. A smart cart interface made for representing the idea from our research paper published in IEEE Xplore. It was made in Python, Javascript: React.js, Express.js, CSS, MongoDB, JWT, Axios and executed on a Raspberry Pi 3. The black book includes the complete report of the system architecture, functions and the code. The paper can be found on IEEE Xplore at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059075/. 

Abstract of the paper:

This research paper presents the 'TAV-Cart,' a creative intelligent shopping cart about to take the retail market to a modern era. The TAV-Cart is an innovative smart shopping cart about to set in motion the evolution of the retail market. It has adopted a solution-oriented approach by introducing a new generation of UPI-based shopping carts that are going to turn the retail industry upside down. It helps them to navigate the stores, select their products, and check the products using the automated barcode scanning technology and the weight verification technology. A light strip inside the cart emphasizes real-time visual information; thus, the scanned products are properly taken care of, which in turn creates a smooth shopping experience. One of the features that the customer can use to pay at the end of their consumer journey is the UPI platform itself, which eliminates the pain of long lines at checkout counters. Very strongly linked with the UPI payments system in India, the TAV-Cart meets the five basic aspects of the UPI system. TAV-Cart emerges as an instrumental solution for modernizing the retail landscape, enhancing shopping efficiency, and catering to evolving consumer preferences. TAV-Cart represents a significant step forward in modernizing the retail experience, aligning with the rapid adoption of UPI as a preferred payment method in India. As the retail landscape continues to evolve, TAV-Cart offers a compelling solution for both customers seeking streamlined shopping experiences and retailers striving to stay competitive in a digital era. The paper also provides concept ideas for other technological improvements that can be made in the supermarket to further ease the shopping journey of the customer. These advancements can be implemented along with the TAV-Cart to automate the entire shopping mart experience.
